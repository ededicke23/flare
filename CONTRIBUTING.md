# Contributing to Flare
First and foremost, thanks for wanting to help make Flare amazing(er)!

To contribute, there's a few steps to take.
1. Fork this Repository
2. Create a new branch named after your feature. For example, if you wanted to add 2FA you could create a branch called `add-2fa`
3. Make your changes on that branch
4. Once it's ready, open a Pull Request to pull your branch into the next release branch
5. A Member of the VANet or Flare team will take a look at your PR. We'll either accept and merge the changes or add a request for you to change something

## Feature Guidelines
Features to be added to Flare must meet the following criteria. Any features that do not meet these criteria will not be added to the main repo.
* Features must not be for pure entertainment. They must provide value to VAs.
* Features must not integrate with the Infinite Flight Live API directly. All integration with IF must be done through VANet.
* Features must not be attributed to their creator. We appreciate your help and your name will be included in the release notes, but please do not add attribution in Flare itself.

## Bug Reports
If you find a bug, please open an issue with the Bug Report template. Please include as much detail as possible in your report. Do not remove any part of the template.
